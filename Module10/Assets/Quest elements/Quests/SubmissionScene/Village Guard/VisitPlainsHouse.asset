  questName: Supplies delivery
  questDescription: One more thing to ask of you. The house to the South-West requested
    we deliver some food to them a while back, but none of these folks seem willing
    to do it. Do you mind taking some over for me? You can buy it from the shop,
    here's some gold.
  questCompleteDialogue: 'Oh, did the guard ask you to deliver these? Thank you my
    dear, no one else in that damned village seems to be up to walking 3 meters down
    the road.

    *She rolls her eyes*'
