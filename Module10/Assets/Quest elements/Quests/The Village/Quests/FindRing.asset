  questDescription: I last remember wearing it while delivering some supplies to
    the tents out in the field, I assume it must have slipped off when I was carrying
    the crates over. I can't give you much in the way of gold, but I have plenty
    of other wares!
  questCompleteDialogue: As always, you've done me a great service. Your reward is
    the new soup recipe I've been working on! A warrior like you will need to keep
    their strength up out there.
