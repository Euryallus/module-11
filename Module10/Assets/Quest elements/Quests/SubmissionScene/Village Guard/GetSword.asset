  questDescription: 'Now, I don''t know if you''ve noticed but these Plains aren''t
    the most friendly place. My spare sword''s sitting on the well over there - Don''t
    worry, it''s not loaded.

    You''re more than welcome to have it.'
  questCompleteDialogue: 'Nice, the ''armed'' look suits you!

    In case you missed
    it, there''s an old supply crate down the road that stores an axe and some rocks.
    Go make yourself some tools, you might need ''em.'
